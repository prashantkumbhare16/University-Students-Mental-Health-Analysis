# University Mental Health Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing mental health trends and factors among university students. The goal is to understand the prevalence and correlates of mental health issues in this population and to identify potential areas for intervention and support.

## Project Structure

- **`index.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and model building.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/university-mental-health-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd university-mental-health-analysis
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook index.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to run the analysis.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from relevant sources, such as surveys or academic databases.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing the data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
4. **Model Building**: Building predictive models to identify factors associated with mental health issues.
5. **Results and Insights**: Interpreting the findings and discussing potential implications.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be included in the `index.ipynb` notebook. Key findings, visualizations, and statistical analyses will be presented to provide insights into the mental health status of university students.
